Interactive Web App This project demonstrates a variety of DOM manipulation techniques using vanilla JavaScript. 
It includes elements, navigating the DOM, iterating over elements, creating and appending elements, using DocumentFragment, modifying HTML content, handling user interactions, and form validation.

Iterate over a collection of elements to perform tasks - Create new elements using `createElement` - Append new elements to the DOM using `appendChild` and `prepend` - Use DocumentFragment or HTML templating with `cloneNode` - Modify HTML or text content in response to user interactions. Modify styles and CSS classes in response to user interactions.
